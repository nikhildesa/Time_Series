# Time Series model
A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data.

Time series are stationary if they do not have trend or seasonal effects. Summary statistics calculated on the time series are consistent over time, like the mean or the variance of the observations.

When a time series is stationary, it can be easier to model. Statistical modeling methods assume or require the time series to be stationary to be effective.

# Dickeyâ€“Fuller test 
To prove the data is stationary or non stationary
